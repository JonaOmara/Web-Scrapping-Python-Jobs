# The Free Python Job Board

## Task : Web scrapping a static website

In this exercise, we aim to implement a web scraping script to systematically retrieve all Python-related job listings from the [Pythonjobs](.\pythonjobs.github.io) website. To accomplish this, we will utilize the `requests` library to handle the HTTP communication with the website, allowing us to fetch the page content. Subsequently, we will employ the `BeautifulSoup`,Â `SoupStrainer` library from `bs4` to parse the HTML content and extract the relevant job data based on predefined HTML tags and attributes. Finally, for the purpose of organizing and displaying the extracted data in a structured and readable format, we will leverage the `pandas` library to create a DataFrame. This DataFrame will then be used to generate a tabular representation of the job listings, which can be further manipulated or analyzed as required.

## Output: DataFrame
